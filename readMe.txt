How to build and run NAE (BRE:IN):
(Based on Judah Goldfeder manual)

Dependencies:
NAE requires both the java SDK and NuSMV to be on the path.  It was tested using java version 1.8.0_144 and NuSMV-2.6.0.

Building:
to build NAE type the following two commands from within the NetworkAnalysisEngine directory:
>javac NAE/*.java validate/*.java
>jar cvfm NAE.jar NAE/manifest.txt NAE/*.class validate/*.class

This creates a file named "NAE.jar"

Running:
The following is the syntax for running NAE from the command line, assuming we are in the NetworkAnalysisEngine directory:
>java -jar NAE.jar  <solution limit> <model file path> <observation file path> <mode>

<Solution limit> is the number of solutions to search for
<model file path> is a path to a model file ending in .net
<observation file path> is a path to a spec file ending in .ltlspec
<mode> is the mode of encoding in NuSMV. Current modes are:
    temporal_logic_bmc:      for use with .ctlspec and .ltlspec files to run the SAT solver with bounded model checking

additionally, there are optional arguments, which, if specified, must be after the 4 required arguments. They are:
-v to perform validation on solutions 
-bmc <length> to specify the bounds of bmc. The default is 20.

.net file:
In case of a special node (strong and weak regulators), the node should be defined as follows:
<node_name>[](81);
and each connection that connects into this node should be defined as follows:
<regulator_name>	<node_name>	positive/negative	strong/weak  [optional];	

Test models:
In the NetworkAnalysisEngine directory are 3 subdirectories named test_models, LTL, and CTL, containing network (.net) and specification files (.spec/.ltlspec/.ctlspec) that we tested on, as well as .smv files generated by NAE (which are not intended to be human readable).

The test models in the LTL directory can be run in temporal_logic_bmc mode.

Source Code:
The complete source code for the tool can be found in the NAE directory, containing the code for the main tool, and the validate directory, containing the source for the validation component.

Understanding the output:
when NAE finishes running, it prints out all the solutions it finds. Solutions are numbered 0 - n-1 and are columns where each row is the name of an uncertain connection between 2 genes.
NAE either marks every optional connection as on or off in each solution. Here is an example output with 8 solutions:
                   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
             B->C :■  ■  ■  ■  ■  ■  ■  ■
             B->A :■  ■        ■        ■
             A->B :            ■  ■  ■  ■
             A->C :   ■     ■        ■  ■ 


Evaluating the tool:

Included in the NetworkAnalysisEngine directory is a bash script named "test" that builds the tool and runs all of the test models under various parameters, printing the results and providing benchmarks. 
Please note that some of the very large models take up a lot of memory and may not run properly if the virtual machine has less than 10 GB of memory. Also, note that some of the benchmarks obtained will be slightly slower on the VM than had NAE been run on a regular machine.
Make sure the terminal window is opened to fullscreen for proper formatting.
the bash script should be run by invoking: 
> bash test

Also included in the NetworkAnalsisEngine directory is a file "benchmark.test" that contains benchmarks for all the models when run on a  machine with the following specs:
64 bit Windows 
16 GB RAM
Processor: Inter Core i7-7700HQ    2.80   GHz

Running NAE without the bashscript:
To aid in running the tool directly to see how it works, the following is a bunch of ready-to-go commands to run NAE from a terminal open to the NetworkAnalysisEngine directory. They can be run as is or modified as the evaluator sees fit.

Running LTL models
The example where in the original version of BREIN there are no solutions for a particular system, but in our extended version there are solutions:
The mammalian cell cycle regulation model   (see reference [1]) - Original version vs. extended version:
java -jar NAE.jar 10 LTL\full_mammalian_cell_cycle_equal_ltl\model.net LTL\full_mammalian_cell_cycle_equal_ltl\observation.ltlspec temporal_logic_bmc
java -jar NAE.jar 10 LTL\full_mammalian_cell_cycle_updated_ltl\model.net LTL\full_mammalian_cell_cycle_updated_ltl\observation.ltlspec temporal_logic_bmc
